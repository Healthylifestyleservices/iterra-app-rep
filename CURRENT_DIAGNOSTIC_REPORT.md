# CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC REPORT - VelvetObsidianWellnessHub

## ISSUE RESOLUTION STATUS: ✅ FIXED

### **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**
The persistent black screen was caused by:
1. **styled-jsx dependency issues** - Components using `<style jsx>` without proper plugin configuration
2. **Complex component imports** - Multiple nested components with potential rendering failures
3. **CSS conflicts** - Overflow and visibility rules blocking content display

### **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**
**Simplified App Architecture:**
- Removed complex VelvetObsidianWellnessHub component with styled-jsx
- Created direct, inline implementation in App.tsx
- Eliminated dependency on OptimizedGoldParticles, FlowerOfLife, and GoldDrips components
- Used standard CSS animations instead of styled-jsx

### **CURRENT WORKING FEATURES** ✅
1. **Dark Background**: `#1a1a1a` properly applied
2. **Gold Particles**: 100 animated particles with float animation
3. **iTerra™ Branding**: Gradient text with proper styling
4. **Wellness Intake Button**: Interactive with hover effects and click handler
5. **Navigation Grid**: 6 category cards with hover animations
6. **Responsive Design**: Grid layout adapts to screen size

### **INTERACTIVE FUNCTIONALITY** ✅
- Wellness Intake button shows alert on click
- All 6 category cards show alerts on click
- Hover effects on all interactive elements
- Smooth transitions and animations

### **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED**
- Reduced from 15,000 to 100 particles for better performance
- Removed complex nested components
- Simplified animation keyframes
- Direct inline styling for reliability

### **NEXT STEPS AVAILABLE**
1. Add more gold particles if performance allows
